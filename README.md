# ex1recon
My work in progress recon script. Dirsearch is set as optional because it takes a lot of time when you do it with few threads and on a list of domains. 

TODO:
- Create a function for each used tool so the user can choose which one to use. 
- Add settings such as wordlist or use another domain list instead of sublist3r's.

# Requirements:
 - [sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)
 - [nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
 - [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)
